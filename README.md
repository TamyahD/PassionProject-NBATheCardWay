# NBA The Card Way

This NBA card collection game is a web application that allows users to battle against one another. A round consists of 2 users each having a hand of 5 cards to emulate an NBA game’s line up. The cards represent NBA players having attributes along with an overall player rating. The winner of a round is determined by the user who has the most higher rated or quality cards out of the 5. The loser of a round must surrender 3 of their cards to the winner.

If a user no longer has the necessary minimum of 5 cards to play a round, they are allowed to draw from a “placeholder deck”, which has a greater percentage of subpar rated cards than high rated. Users have the option of viewing a showcase of their total collected cards in the main menu.
